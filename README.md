# Observable Notebooks
Ever since I learned about Observable at NICAR 2019, I've been trying to find ways to use the platform. I think Observable has so much potential and I'm very much looking forward to integrating it into my workflows. 
## Missouri Small Water Systems Map

I built this map in Observable using D3 and TopoJSON. I did the necessary data processing using an R script and hosted the resulting csv file in a gist. The map is meant to show the number of small water systems that use chlorine across the state of Missouri and the median age of those systems. I added a tooltip in the notebook, but since this eventually turned into a static graphic, it wasn't used in production. 
## Missouri House/Senate Bill Process Graphic

This is a newsroom tool I created using Jeremy Ashkenas' Inputs library and D3. The Columbia Missourian's graphic desk came up with an idea to illustrate to readers where bills are in the legislative process. However, these graphics were generic, and didn't have any other information about the bill attached to them. I wanted to see if I could find a way to use Observable to make these graphics custom, in real-time by using information written by the 30+ Missourian reporters who cover the Missouri legislature from week to week.

# Observable Notebooks
Ever since I learned about Observable at NICAR 2019, I've been trying to find ways to use the platform. I think Observable has so much potential and I'm very much looking forward to integrating it into my workflows. 
## Missouri Small Water Systems Map

I built this map in Observable using D3 and TopoJSON. I did the necessary data processing using an R script and hosted the resulting csv file in a gist. The map is meant to show the number of small water systems that use chlorine across the state of Missouri and the median age of those systems. I added a tooltip in the notebook, but since this eventually turned into a static graphic, it wasn't used in production.
